Overview
========

.. warning::

   If you are using a released version of LLVM, see `the download page
   <http://llvm.org/releases/>`_ to find your documentation.

The LLVM compiler infrastructure supports a wide range of projects, from
industrial strength compilers to specialized JIT applications to small
research projects.

Similarly, documentation is broken down into several high-level groupings
targetted at different audiences:

  * **Design & Overview**

    Several introductory papers and presentations are available at
    :ref:`design_and_overview`.

  * **Publications**

    The list of `publications <http://llvm.org/pubs>`_ based on LLVM.

  * **User Guides**

    Those new to the LLVM system should first vist the :ref:`userguides`.

    NOTE: If you are a user who is only interested in using LLVM-based
    compilers, you should look into `Clang <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ or
    `DragonEgg <http://dragonegg.llvm.org>`_ instead. The documentation here is
    intended for users who have a need to work with the intermediate LLVM
    representation.

  * **API Clients**

    Developers of applications which use LLVM as a library should visit the
    :ref:`programming`.

  * **Subsystems**

    API clients and LLVM developers may be interested in the
    :ref:`subsystems` documentation.

  * **Development Process**

    Additional documentation on the LLVM project can be found at
    :ref:`development_process`.

  * **Mailing Lists**

    For more information, consider consulting the LLVM :ref:`mailing_lists`.
